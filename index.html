        "Hi my name is Gerardo and I love the martial arts. Theyre a way to express yourself 
        and every person can have there own way. If big and expressive movements is your thing TKD ,
         Muay thai and kickboxing could work"</p>
        
        
        <p>"If you like calm steady movement Tai chi or Aikido could work."
        " Starting isnt easy but soon you can experience the results."</p>
        <p>"Martial arts are much more than kicking butt, they teach you life lessons and humility when taught correctly.
        You do not need pick fights , 
        you dont need to prove anything to anyone.</p>
